## Mesh Graph Networks

This example contains LBANN implementation of mesh-based graph neural network with 
syntheticly generated data. 

---
### Running the example

The data-parallel model can be run with the synthetic data with: 

```bash
python Trainer.py --mini-batch-size <Global_MB_size> --num-epochs <number of epochs>
```
