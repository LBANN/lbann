#You must edit this file prior to use as follows.
#
#  Uncomment the 'pack' entries for whichever data fields you wish to use.
#  pack's value should be one of the following: datum, label, response.
#  If you do not wish to use a data field, simply leave 'pack' commented out
#
#  For normalization, uncomment and add appropriate values to the 'scale'
#  and 'bias' entries.  For images, the 'scale' and 'bias' entries should be
#  lists with one entry per channel. You should also add the following
#  entries for images: dims, channels. Here is an example of the metadata
#  entries for images:
#    dims: [300,300]
#    channels: 2
#    scale: [1.23, 4.56]
#    bias:  [1.0, 2.0]
#
#  The 'ordering' entries determine how data is packed into a vector
#  e.g, when you have multiple 'pack: response' entries. The values in the
#  ordering entries need not be unique and are relative
#
