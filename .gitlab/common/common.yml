# Variables for LBANN CI.
.lbann-base-vars:
  variables:
    # This is based on the assumption that each runner will only ever
    # be able to run one pipeline on a given cluster at one time.
    SPACK_ENV_BASE_NAME: gitlab-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}-${GITLAB_USER_LOGIN}-${SYSTEM_NAME}${SPACK_ENV_BASE_NAME_EXTENSION}-${CI_RUNNER_SHORT_TOKEN}

    # This variable is the name used to identify the job in the Slurm
    # queue. We need this to be able to access the correct jobid.
    JOB_NAME: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_${CI_PIPELINE_ID}

    # This is needed to ensure that we run as lbannusr.
    LLNL_SERVICE_USER: lbannusr

    # Catch2 output.
    # This directory is a pipeline-unique dumping ground for any
    # output files that would be hard to track down later. (In
    # particular, I ran a few tests where some stages had multiple
    # "spack-build-*" directories, so they were reporting dozens of
    # xml files of Catch2 output (there should be 17 -- 1 seq, 8 mpi,
    # 8 mpi-fs). Since the "*" there is a hash that's not computable
    # in this file, we cannot specify it correctly in an "artifacts"
    # section. So we just create our own results cache with known
    # name.
    #
    # NOTE: directories specified in a pipeline file are relative to
    # ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}. Therefore, shell scripts should be sure of
    # their working directory before attempting to use this as a
    # relative path. Alternatively, they should prefix
    # ${CI_PROJECT_DIR} and use absolute paths (absolute paths are not
    # allowed in pipeline files either, which is why this is not an
    # absolute path).
