# This is the testing pipeline for the Pascal cluster at LLNL. This
# cluster builds the LBANN applications and libraries using a single
# compiler toolchain and then runs a collection of tests. Testing
# output is in JUnit format and parsed by the pipeline for web
# viewing.

# See the Catalyst pipeline for more thorough documentation.
