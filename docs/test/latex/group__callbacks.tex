Dump weight matrices to files. This will dump each hidden layer\textquotesingle{}s weight/bias matrix after each epoch. The matrices are written to files using Elemental\textquotesingle{}s simple A\+S\+C\+II format. This is not meant for checkpointing, but for exporting weight matrices for analysis that isn\textquotesingle{}t easily done in L\+B\+A\+NN.
